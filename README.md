My Story

The Intro
<p>I was born in the Kumogakure or the village in the cloud (not really) when I was born though I was taken away from my mom and I lived with my grandma she taught me many things from reading and writing to fighting since she was a teacher she taught me like she taught her class. although I learned many different jutsu I was still bullied and beat up all of this caused me to be more of an introvert in my younger years. I mostly stayed inside since every time I went outside I would get into fights since I was mostly in the house I read a lot of books and scroll that consisted of a lot of history and different jutsu I when I went to school I excelled in everything that was given to me and I always finished early I was a very hype kid still am add can cause that I’ve always wanted to do more get done with stuff faster so I can more things witch I joined a program when I was a genin witch was allow me to be eligible for a hokage position once I was promoted to jonin I took this seriously even though I didn’t plan on becoming a hokage I was planning on becoming a sensei I always wanted to teach on January the 5th I went on my first mission it was  to deliver a box containing a “secret item” although it wasn’t when we first left about 2 hours into our walk there we ran into a group of bandits who wanted to take the box from us we fought a tough battle although we ended up beating the bandits most of us decided to give up because it was too “hard” although this was our first mission dropping our number by a lot. With there being a lot less they told us we had to work harder I was put in a group with two other ninja named Jared and jihad we planned on hanging in this thing till the end</p>
